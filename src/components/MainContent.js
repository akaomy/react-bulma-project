                    <p>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to
                        demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful
                        content.</p>

                <div className="tile is-child box">
                    <h2 className="title">Source text</h2>
                    <p>The discovery of the text's origin is attributed to Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar at
                        Hampdenâ€“Sydney College. McClintock connected Lorem ipsum to Cicero's writing sometime
                        before 1982 while searching for instances of the Latin word consectetur, which was rarely
                        used in classical literature.[4] McClintock first published his discovery in a 1994 letter
                        to the editor of Before & After magazine, contesting the editor's earlier claim that Lorem
                        ipsum had no meaning.[5]</p>

                    <p>Lorem ipsum passages were popularized on Letraset dry-transfer sheets from the early 1970s,
                        which were produced to be used by graphic designers for filler text.[3][4] Aldus Corporation
                        created a version in the mid-1980s for their desktop publishing program PageMaker.</p>
